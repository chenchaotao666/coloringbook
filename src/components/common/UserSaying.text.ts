We used to search for specific coloring books, but now she can just describe her \'butterfly-kittens\' or \'dino-puppies\' and have a brand new page to color in seconds. It\'s absolutely magical to watch."',

I started using this to make art pages based on our weekly vocabulary words, and the difference has been night and day. When kids can color a \'courageous firefighter\' or a \'mysterious jungle,\' the words stick. It\'s an invaluable classroom resource."',
