They enhance concentration and patience while fostering creativity and imagination. During coloring, children's hand-eye coordination and fine motor skills are exercised. It's also a great way to relieve stress and help children relax. Coloring also strengthens color recognition and improves aesthetic sense. For adults, coloring is also a great way to relax and relieve stress. Additionally, coloring can become a bond for quality family time, enhancing parent-child relationships.",
